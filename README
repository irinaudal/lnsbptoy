# Computing summary for LNSBP project #

- Added files to repository
- Tested the bp code
- Included the single Pareto functionality. For this, must change hyper parameters: a,b,mu,C.
- Checking validations
- TODO: precompute pi(theta)


## Validation ##

- bp model with constant g=0.08 and constant pi=0.8 is validated.
- All bp models with g=Normal-CDF have failed because pi is approximated via MC. This appears to be the issue.
